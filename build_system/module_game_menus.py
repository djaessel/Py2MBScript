Remember that in the traditional medieval society depicted in the game, war and politics are usually dominated by male members of the nobility. That does not however mean that you should not choose to play a female character, or one who is not of noble birth. Male nobles may have a somewhat easier start, but women and commoners can attain all of the same goals -- and in fact may have a much more interesting if more challenging early game.",

  "You now possess land in your name, without being tied to any kingdom. This makes you a monarch in your own right, with your court temporarily located at {s12}. However, the other kings in Calradia will at first consider you a threat, for if any upstart warlord can grab a throne, then their own legitimacy is called into question.^^You may find it desirable at this time to pledge yourself to an existing kingdom. If you want to continue as a sovereign monarch, then your first priority should be to establish an independent right to rule. You can establish your right to rule through several means -- marrying into a high-born family, recruiting new lords, governing your lands, treating with other kings, or dispatching your companions on missions.^^At any rate, your first step should be to appoint a chief minister from among your companions, to handle affairs of state. Different companions have different capabilities.^You may appoint new ministers from time to time. You may also change the location of your court, by speaking to the minister.",
